# Assignment 2
Create a tip calculator in HTML and JavaScript.

## Requirements
- The `<title>` of the document is "Assignment 2".
- The JavaScript will live in a separate file, called `main.js`.
- The CSS will live in a separate file, called `style.css`.
- The HTML will use a `<script>` tag to link to the external JavaScript.
- The HTML will use a `<link>` tag to link to the external CSS.
- This tip calculator has two HTML inputs and an HTML button.
- The first HTML input contains total bill amount, entered by the user.
- The second HTML input contains tip percentage, entered by the user.
- If the HTML inputs contain any content that can't be used to generate the tip, let the user know.
- The HTML button calculates the tip based on the two inputs.
- The tip itself is presented on the screen after the user clicks the button.
- The total amount with tip is presented on the screen after the user clicks the button.
- The elements of the page will be in the center of the screen, using flexbox.

## Tips
- Use `<div>` to arbitrarily group components in HTML.
- Put the `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>` to ensure all HTML elements are present before it executes.
- Use `class` or `id` to quality HTML elements so they are easy to capture in JavaScript.
- Use `console.info` to write information to the console from JavaScript.
- Right-click and use the "Inspect" option when viewing your HTML document to see the console.
- Use `document.querySelector()` to capture HTML elements in JavaScript.
- Use `addEventListener()` to add behaviors when users take actions in JavaScript.
- Use `alert()` to write a message to the user in JavaScript.
